# AdventOfCode2023
My solutions for the AdventOfCode 2023 - an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.
Puzzles consist of two parts that must be solved in order, with the second part not revealed to the user until the first part is solved correctly.
Participants earn one golden star for each part they finish, giving a possible total of two stars per day and fifty stars per year.
Each puzzle contains a fictional backstory that is the same for all participants, but each person receives a different piece of input data and should generate a different correct result.

**Puzzles**
- Day 1: Extract the first and last number from a string both in digit or text and calculate.

Example: "agaonetwo2fo7three" -> 13
- Day 2: Group and categorize specific strings. Calculate and find maximum.

Example: "Game 1: 3 green, 2 red; 1 blue, 5 red, 4 green" -> max: 5 red, 4 green, 1 blue
